Release notes for GStreamer OpenGL Plug-ins 0.10.1 "Le Fromage De La Belle France"
        


The GStreamer team is proud to announce a new release
in the 0.10.x stable series of the GStreamer OpenGL Plug-ins.


The 0.10.x series is a stable series targeted at end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.8.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.8.x series.

Please note that at this time, the GStreamer GL plugins
        module is not considered API/ABI stable, and public interfaces
        may change from release to release.



This module contains integration libraries and plug-ins for using OpenGL within
GStreamer pipelines.

This module contains elements for, among others:

  output: glimagesink
  adapters: glupload, gldownload
  video processing: gldeinterlace, glcolorscale
  GL effects: glfiltersobel, glfilterblur, gleffects, others
  sources: gltestsrc


Other modules containing plug-ins are:


gst-plugins-base
contains a basic set of well-supported plug-ins
gst-plugins-good
contains a set of well-supported plug-ins under our preferred license
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plug-ins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad
contains a set of less supported plug-ins that haven't passed the
    rigorous quality testing we expect
